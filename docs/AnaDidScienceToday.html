<p>Wonderful to see the Big Dipper and the Southern Cross together, and the equatorian-hammock-smiling moon. Wish I had the poetry skills to write something beautiful about it.</p>
<p>We worked on coral identification, benthic relief, and used interesting methods to randomize sampling.</p>
<p>Coral ID was done by dropping a 1m long bar with 5 markings on it. The bar was to be dropped randomly in a zig zag pattern around the reef. Corals touched by the bar to be IDd.</p>

<p>Coral spawning is timed abased on light spectra cues given by the full moon and the sunset. Once the full moon is up, and the setting sun is at the expected angle for each specific species, they spawn within 15 minutes of each other. Studies have been done to shade coral during spawning time, showing they needed the correct lighting cues. Main method of reproductive isolation is timing. When timing overlaps, they develop other methods to inviabilize fertilization.</p>

<p>Conspecific negative density-dependence: Do corals also tend to settle far away from their parent, like trees? - Few ongoing studies! Unsure if corals tend to avoid their own species rather than other species (heterospecific negative density-dependence). - On healthy reefs, monospecific stands are rare.</p>
<p>How do strategies differ between shallow and deep water corals?</p>
<p>Corals seem understudied.</p>

<p>Doing science in Latin America is reminding me of the possibilities I’ve missed out on by being in North America. I am truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve had, and I recognize my open doors are the result of lots of hard work by myself and many others and even more luck, but at the same time it is painful that to be this privileged, I had to leave Brazil, and that people like me became biologists in a place where the profession is undervalued, with a president who destroys all that has to do with conservation and science.</p>

<ul>
<li>On connecting with Daniel on [[2024-01-11 Thu]], we talked about education and its role in forest conservation, as well as livelihoods. This seems to be part of every successful conservation project, like the TAMAR in Brazil - where turtle fishermen were given jobs in ecotourism and taught the importance of turtles to the ecosystem to the tourists instead of killing them - and the jaguar conservation project in Panama, where camera traps were installed in campesinos’ properties so they could see the jaguars in their land and relate to them. I would be curious to gather stories from other successful ecological awareness projects and what they have in common across ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, ==I am curious about the difference between the attitudes of fishermen across both oceans on sea turtle and shark fishing==, and what that means for the populations of these two animals.</p>

<p>Very exciting to see an older generation latin american female scientist being a leader in her field.</p>
<p>Mapping in her era was extremely difficult. Daviken and her both believe that using paper maps can be beneficial (and in her case, drawing the maps yourself) for understanding of geography. ==Mapping seagrass and different types of coral reefs is harder to do on satellite than manually.==</p>

<p>Gloria and her husband are the first people to plant marine algae in Central America. He worked on an oil refinery, and at that time there was a large oil spill. The worker of the refinery met the marine biologist Gloria to try to protect the environment and they’ve been married for 25 years. They wanted to recover what was damaged from the spill.</p>
<p>She started developing a macroalgae project. Now they sell marine algae to Europe. The company has existed for as long as they’ve been&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>[[Ecosystemology]] is a book she introduced to us.</p>
<p>At some point, the library they built was destroyed by the American soldiers during the Panamanian invasion.</p>
<p>There is a division of labour in seaweed farming - women prepare the seeds, men plant them into the ocean. They can be planted with low water, but with sea level rise it can become too deep for the algae and generates tall waves.</p>
<p>In Colón, people sell dry algae to be consumed as drinks. They produce algae with indigenous peoples. The government has invited them to do projects with carbon sequestration but they don’t work with it yet. They are not sure if this is a truly useful solution or if it is an attempt of governments to greenwash.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guna-people-usage-of-algae-for-food-and-medicine">Guna people usage of algae for food and medicine</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/es/c/1538466/">Las algas brindan nuevas oportunidades a los pescadores indígenas en Panamá&nbsp;|&nbsp;Historias de la FAO&nbsp;|&nbsp;Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura</a></p>
<p>She noticed that Guna people were working with macroalgae. It is healthy for stomach, as people were ill from hunger and constantly changing diets. She published much about the indigenous and caribbean afroantillanos usage of algae. The local inaduledi (pajé) would help classify the algae. They were used for healing as well as chants and dances. The inaduledi communicates with auxiliares that treat the ill, diagnose, practice infirmary, and attend epidemics.</p>
<p>There has been good documentation of how these people use land plants, but this was a new project that incorporated algae.</p>
<p><strong>How is the market for these algae, and do the same people also work with sustainable agriculture and/or agroforestry?</strong> - The Guna people mainly live in islands so they are very reliant on the sea. They have been moved to the land due to sea level rise. Historically they lived on land, but the Spaniards expelled many of them to the sea. However, there are still some on land and some in Colombia.</p>
<p>Panama is the first country (at least in Latin America an the Caribbean) that have started a program to move communities due to&nbsp;climate&nbsp;change</p>
<p>I’m remembering a really cool <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835452/#:~:text=The%20Kuna%20Indians%20who%20reside,least%20on%20their%20death%20certificates.">study</a> I read with regards to the Guna people and heart disease, back in the 1990s. The study showed that the Guna originally had no heart disease issues, and as they moved to the city they started developing heart disease issues.</p>
<p>Algae can be an interesting food supplement - the guna of san blas (guna yala), that consume algae, are taller and more robust than the guna of bayano. The difference can be attributed to diet or physical conditions.</p>
<p>New skin for burns can be made from algae.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sea-cucumber-farming">Sea cucumber farming</h3>
<p>We visited an aquaculture facility near Colón. The company, PanaSea, collects sea cucumbers from the seagrass during their egg-laying season, which is 4 days before every full or new moon. I appreciate the idea of a project that works on commercialization of a natural product, while also working on the restoration of ecosystems through mangrove seedlings and reintroduction of sea cucumbers into the depleted seagrass.</p>
<p>It was interesting to learn how mangrove seedlings can choose where to settle by controlling their buoyancy. One more point on corals and plants and plankton having more choice than we’d give them credit for.</p>
<p>It was really disappointing to see the presentation by a French masters’ student that had no results and spoke as if he did, with terribly insignificant plots. It was, however, an interesting opportunity to converse with Jarrod on keeping expectations high and toxicity low in academia by providing feedback when it’s warranted while never assuming malintent.</p>
</section>
<section id="snorkeling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="snorkeling">Snorkeling</h3>
<p>The beach has the most coral skeleton that I’ve ever seen. It’s incredibly shallow with few waves. Seabirds are either small andorinhas or large pelicans, no seagulls or albatrosses to be seen. I’m sure there’s medium sized birds somewhere.</p>
<p>Seagrass bed was beautiful, with interesting round algae (Penicill) and colourful fish living within it. Coral reef seemed surprisingly degraded. Absence of: - starfish - large crustaceans - sharks - turtles - jellyfish Little presence of: - small crustaceans - schools of fish Plenty of: - fire coral - non-schooling like damselfish and butterflyfish - dead patches - bleached coral Notable presence: - large barracuda (at least 1m) - large blowfish</p>
<p>The reef reminded me a lot of Arraial do Cabo, but with no coral-sol to be seen, and very warm shallow waters. Arraial, however, has larger reef fish and more sea turtles, and is in an upwelling zone. ### Conversation with Carrie #### Random thoughts - corals are animals, so they are not equal to trees in the sense that the larvae do have some matter of choice of where to settle. There are some interesting similarities between coral reefs and forest ecosystems. - ==theoretical modelling of metaecosystem dispersal would be also nicely applied to coral reefs. Unlike large land predators, large marine predators can disperse more easily without the impedement of roads and farms.== - segmentation modelling can also be done to identify coral species in coral reefs. There are also #### Coral morphology</p>

<li>The corals grow in different shapes depending on the environment, like plasticity in trees. A coral can also change its phenotype depending on its lifetime.</li>
<li>Corals can hybridize into chimeras.</li>
<li>Distinguishing species can be hard. Molecular evidence and reproductive studies are conducted for the answer.</li>
<li>One “mouth” is one individual! So what looks like an individual “coral” is a colony of many little mouths bundled together, each one belonging to an individual. They are characterized based on:
<ul>
<li>colony shape</li>
<li>the sharing of walls (shared, separate, absent)</li>
<li>Septa, costae, septo-costae #### Bleaching and invasive corals ##### bleaching</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They get rid of their zooxanthellae as oxygen reactive species become too much of a problem. The tissue gets discolored. It can recover if this is not long. ##### has a bleached region ever been successfully restored?</li>
<li>not yet :(((( there are efforts, a largest one done in Florida, but no reef recovered yet</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ADp4gi.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Percentage of living coral cover of what are coral communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>corals have different life strategies - stress-tolerant slow growing, stress-intolerant fast growers, and unstable life strategies. Photogrametry is also used here to measure tree cover.</li>
<li>Disease also affects coral communities, as well as storms, temperature rise and pH. Diseases are more of a common issue in the caribbean, as it suffers from lots of direct sewage pollution and agriculture runoff (deforestation kills corals too! through sedimentation).</li>
<li>Many oil spills are also an issue around Panama.</li>
</ul>
<section id="symbiosis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="symbiosis">Symbiosis</h4>
<ul>
<li>the endosymbiosis of zooxanthellae and corals provides them with food but also restricts their range based on the range of the symbiont. They can shift their ranges and shift back depending on the conditions. Also, there needs to be the ideal conditions for coral to grow. One of which is low nutrients, because where there are algae they suffer from competition with algae.</li>
<li>There’s a large range of environments you can find</li>
<li>coral and symbiotic relationship with algae - do most of them do it?
<ul>
<li>the vast majority of corals in the photic zone has zooxanthellae. many in more darkness do not.</li>

<li>some corals do have pigments.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fri---crane-day">12/01/2014, Fri - Crane day</h2>
<p>The crane is 50m long, 60m tall. There was a lot of illumination on the top of the canopy, and the ground looked very dark when seen from the top, although the trails look well lit when you’re walking through them - gives a good perspective on the light gradient and competition. ==I wonder what is the increase gain in information with an increase in resolution in SAR and LiDAR-measured plots,== and when does the increase in resolution reach a moment that it is just too much. Say, 2cm is useless information! Where in between 100m and 2cm is optimal biomass resolution? I’d guess somewhere around 30-60m, as a large tree crown seems to easily be 15m wide.</p>
<p>Top-down or bottom-up dominance - evolutionary ecologists need information from community ecologists to understand what currently goes on (where are herbivores more diverse, and how does that vary in relation with producer diversity?) to then extrapolate into the past. ==I wonder what theoretical models have been done about this.==</p>
<p>Bryophyte biodiversity with Mikol - it was a bit annoying to feel like I was being treated like a high schooler in the beginning, but once he understood I already knew basic plant taxonomy it was AWESOME. Got to see liverwort and red algae in a pond full of tadpoles. Held frog eggs on my hand, they look like foam but from up close are tiny tiny eggs.</p>
<p>Katie asked Mikol about the most threatened forest in Panama, and he said it is the dry forest as people don’t recognize it as a real forest. I have a feeling this is a local phenomenon, as wet forests in South America, Africa and SE Asia are definitely very threatened. Which forests are more threatened, dry or wet? - the Cerrado deforestation has risen by 40% while Amazon deforestation has decreased by 50% over the past year - I WAS WRONG! Dry tropical forests are more threatened! To check whether that is a result of disturbance or deforestation. - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219281/#:~:text=The%20rain%20forest%20is%20not,dry%20forests%20hold%20this%20honor.">Tropical Dry Forests The Most Endangered Major Tropical Ecosystem - Biodiversity - NCBI Bookshelf</a></p>

<p>Panamanian have pride in their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Watermelon slice incident - one american “bought” a watermelon slice from a panamanian but did not want to pay. a huge fight started and 16 people died.</p>
<p>Jan 9th is Panama Martyr Day - around 1964 40-60 students died bringing the Panamanian flag to be hasteada in the Panama Canal area, after the US disrespected an agreement to put both flags in the area. This made the government of Panama more determined to get the canal area back from the US. The flag was taken and ripped in half. It was reconstructed and is now in a museum. There is a monument to them under the name of the red cross volunteer that was one of the leaders of the monument.</p>
<p>End of 70s was the Carter treaty where they gave the land back to Panama. Was signed by General Turrizo, who actually had consideration for the people’s well being. Panama progressed after independence from the US.</p>
<p>Dec 18 1989 - US military wanted to kill a panamanian general and bombed and destroyed the whole Canal zone. This was due to a part of the CIA wanting to allow drug dealing to reach the US in their efforts to emprison and enslave poor people as prison workers for crack cocaine consumption.</p>
<p>The president that signed the treaty with the US for independence from Colombia did not know English well, so there is a chance he did not understand he was giving away a critical part of his country. Americans lived as kings in Panamanian soil while the locals starved. With the killing of Panamanians in the 80s, people still resent the US.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thu---davikendaniel">11/01/2024, Thu - Daviken/Daniel</h2>
<p>Daviken spoke about decolonizing science - mentioned the book that Holly had mentioned before as well, [[Decolonizing Methodology]] by [[Linda Thuhui Smith]]. We mentioned the dialogue that must happen between indigenous communities and scientists, which has historically been a dismissal of the indigenous as scientists occupy their land as if it’s empty (violating territorial sovereignty). The conversation was geared much towards the relationship between the researcher and the people at the targeted communities. I feel like there is space for more discussions on the role of scientists as active agents - activists - on the issues that these communities face.</p>
<p>Daniel was speaking as a leader of an NGO that works with social-environmental issues in Panama, ranging from gender issues to indigenous territorial sovereignty. He is a biologist, so also a scientist, but he is very involved with social work now, which is interesting. Over dinner he spoke as if he was almost less a biologist because of it? It’s a sentiment I can understand, but it’s interesting to see the gradients that exist between the social and biological sciences and how they overlap in different ways, and how a biologist can be so successfully involved with communities while still addressing conservation. He mentioned how some of the malnutrition that happens in Ngobe Bugle region is due to them being displaced from their ancestral land by the spaniards and having to find refuge in poorer areas which are naturally not forested. So, land sovereignty is also an issue of food security - I assume the peoples who are able to maintain their ancestral lands (which tend to be richer) and keep it undisturbed have less nourishment issues. Also connects to the Yanomami that starved after the garimpeiros arrived. Also, we talked how introduction of processed foods and refined sugars is an issue everywhere and brings addiction (like alcohol) and diabetes.</p>
<p>Also, we talked about respecting people’s right to choose what happens through their land, campesinos and indigenous alike. We mentioned how protecting the nature is a matter of social equality. Panama is incredibly socially unequal, with an income index skewed high due to the large social gaps. This also makes medications so incredibly expensive here that people bring medications from neighboring countries and even from the US. Whenever there is poverty, nature is the first to suffer. Also reminds of the conversation with Gabriel, on the campesinos that killed the harpia and the jaguar for killing chickens. People don’t have the same respect for the environment when they don’t understand its value and they have food insecurity. Their work with education is likely as important as their work with agroforestry. They are also involved with Jeff Hall’s reforestation project. Also, there was a lot of talk of the mining activities of gold and copper and how many of them have thankfully been closed. They were right in the middle of the mesoamerican corridor, which is also a very awesome thing, an agreement across Central american countries to assure a wildlife corridor.</p>
<p>I would like to incorporate a mix of both Daviken’s and Daniel’s talks today. Still approach my work from a researcher’s lens, with the people I’m working with as aware consenting parts of the project, and also as a part of the community myself, within Brazil and LatAm, to think of how I can help support people in my region. My project proposal will definitely be more on this end of the thing.</p>
